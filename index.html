				<p>
					Hi, I'm <b>Noosh</b>! I am the creator of this website here and boy it was not easy to make... 
					making stuff about myself is very much not my strong suit. Here's a few random little basic tidbits about me:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I am 24 years old (very recently)</li>
					<li>My brain silly</li>
					<li>I like my friends</li>
					<li>I like video games</li>
					<li>I like understanding things even when it doesn't really matter</li>
					<li>I didn't know that my birthday was going to be during exam season and now I'm a bit miffed about it</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Don't reallly have much else to say. Do check out the <a href="formatting.html">formatting page</a> if anything, It's got a cool custom feature for website I worked really hard on.
				</p>

			<div class="griditem -g1x2">
				<h3>Other sites</h3>
				<p>Lemme show you another website I designed:</p>
				<a class="coollink" href="https://100truegame.neocities.org/">Myths are 100% True</a>
				<a href="https://100truegame.neocities.org/"><img src="assets/100truegame.png"></a>
				<p>It's a site advertising the unreleased indie game I'm a fan of, <i>Myth's are 100% True</i>. There's a demo out now too, if you're interested. I'm real proud of the work I did on this site, even the devs saw it.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="griditem -g1x2">
				<p>
					I wish I figured out a better color scheme for this site. I mean, Windows 98 grey isn't the WORST color aesthetic, but still.
				</p>
				<p>
					The scrolling background objects are from a game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701030/MINDWAVE/"><i>MINDWAVE</i></a>, by the way. 
					Do consider checking it out, it's pretty cool. (it's also currently only a demo)
				</p>
				<p>
					The the birthday confetti is from <a href="https://confetti.js.org/">https://confetti.js.org/</a>. 
					It was frustrating to get properly working, but I just <b>really</b> wanted confetti.
				</p>

				<h3>heehee.png</h3>
				<p>
					This guy is a doodle I made on the first day of school. I used it in many things since, 
					as a profile picture or a picture to include in something or a placeholder.
					He's just my funny looking guy, I guess...
