<title>Welcome Blog</title>
<p>
	Welcome to the cool blog page. This is the first blog post!
</p>
<p>
	Basically, how the blog works is that it checks for numbered .htm files in the "/posts" directory, starting at 0.
	It'll increment the number and keep doing it until it tries and doesn't find a file, in which case it'll stop looking.
</p>
<p>
	The post content are inserted into a div straight from the .htm file, and It'll extract text from a "title" tag to use as the post's header.
	I know I could have just included the header in here, but actually this way is more convenient, because the header is also used as the text for the link
	in the Table of Contents, as well as the copy of the table of contents that can be found in the mobile navigation menu.
